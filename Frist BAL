         STM   14,12,12(13)  Save registers 14,15, and 0 thru 12 in caller's Save area
         LR    12,15         Set up base register with program's entry point address
         USING HELLO,12      Tell assembler which register we are using for pgm. base
         LA    15,SAVE       Now Point at our own save area
         ST    15,8(13)      Set forward chain
